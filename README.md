## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic not only led to economic disruptions but also had profound social consequences, including increased mental health issues and reduced human interactions. Afloat emerges as a response to these challenges, focusing on LUMS students who faced isolation during the virtual semester. The application aims to bridge gaps in mental health support and social connectivity.

## Research Methodology

The research involved a qualitative study with 20 participants, exploring user pain points and testing both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes. Insights from interviews with students and therapists informed the design process.

## Key Findings

The findings highlighted two primary issues: difficulties in seeking professional mental help and challenges in building social connections. The closure of the LUMS campus during COVID-19 intensified these problems, leading to increased loneliness and a desire for meaningful social interactions.

## Application Design

Details about the design process, wireframes, and high-fidelity prototypes are included in this repository. The application, Afloat, is introduced as a solution that leverages user preferences to match individuals with friends and therapists.

## Testing and Feedback

The application underwent testing with the target users, and feedback from these sessions is documented. The evaluation directory contains user responses, improvements made based on feedback, and insights gained during the testing phase.
